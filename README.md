This is a program to classify sentiment in Amazon reviews using Bag-of-Words and a logistic regression.
Variables have been clipped to reduce execution time and stop overflow - however the code is still slow. 
Increasing the number of epochs wil increase accuracy of the model but will further slow down the model - as I am impatient the epochs are kept quite low. Increase at your own risk.
Code is hosted on Colab.
